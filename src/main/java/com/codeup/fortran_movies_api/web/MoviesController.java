@CrossOrigin //this is to help with local dev testing
@RestController
//registers the class with Spring's Dependency Injector (more on that later) and is handled in particular ways.
//  Among those ways is the elimination of a need to annotate every controller method with @ResponseBody.
//Most importantly, @RestController allows us to signify that a controller exists for the purpose of sending/receiving data.

@RequestMapping(value = "/api/movies", headers = "Accept=application/json")
//annotation that we are informing Spring of how to direct requests to MoviesController, as well as what type of data is accepted
//this is like a mail delivery that tells to send mail to a certain neighborhood
//and later will route requests to specific methods in a class likf from neighborhood to a specific home
//From api/movies, we can further define what requests go to which methods.
//i.e., GET requests on api/movies go to the method annotated with @GetMapping.
//and DELETE requests on api/movies/{id} go to @DeleteMapping("{id}").
//!!! üßê Serialization/Deserialization in Spring Using Spring, we do not need to convert objects to and from JSON with another dependency.

    //    @GetMapping // is called a *composed annotation*. Meaning, its behaviors are composed of the actions of other annotations.
//      `@GetMapping` acts as a shortcut for`@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`.
//       To use it, simply place @GetMapping over your desired REST controller method:
//    @GetMapping
//    private List<Movie> getAll() {
//        ...
//    }
//    From this point, any valid GET request sent to /api/movies will be routed to getAll().
    // when typed in correct URL it will download all movies
